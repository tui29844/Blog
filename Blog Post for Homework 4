Homework 04

Advantages of Virtual Machines:
There are many advantages of virtual machines such as:
-The ability to be made and be deleted quickly
-They allow you to run different operating systems that your main OS wouldn’t normally be capable of
-They are easy to maintain since they aren’t physical objects.

Advantages of Containers:
-They are less wasteful as they only consume resources when they need to
-The applications contained in the containers can be accessed easily on different operating systems
-They are lightweight as they do not require an entire OS to function

Physical Machines over Virtual Machines:
While physical machines have downfalls such as requiring maintenance, they have plenty of benefits for certain types of businesses. 
Physical machines are more powerful than virtual machines so for a company that has a lot of data, it would be better 
to have a physical machine rather than a virtual machine. Also since they are stored on-site, this allows for businesses 
to have direct access to the machines in order to make immediate changes.

How the cloud would aid microservices: 
In my understanding, it allows for the developers to easily update and further develop their program while also 
allowing for others to do so at the same time. I like to think of it as like a google document 
for a class project. It allows for each of the members of the group to be able to edit and download the document 
all at the same time even with others working on it. Even without being on the same internet, you can be all over the 
world and still access and edit the document with your peers.
