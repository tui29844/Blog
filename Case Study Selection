Assignment: Case Study Selection

  For my case study selection, I would like to choose the Soundcloud microservice. Soundcloud is an app that I like to use from time to time
so I have interest in learning more about what goes on behind the scenes. Roughly, Soundcloud is a service that allows anyone to upload their audio files to
their site. If your uploads get a lot of interaction and plays, you get paid. I think it is a very intriguing topic that I would like to learn more about.
